# Requirement Registry Index

The requirement universe is split into two registries to separate normative conformance from project policy constraints.

- Normative registry: `REQ_REGISTRY_NORMATIVE.md`
- Policy registry: `REQ_REGISTRY_POLICY.md`

Current counts:
- Normative requirements: 54
- Policy requirements: 47
- Total requirements: 101

Conformance coverage is enforced against the union of both registries.
