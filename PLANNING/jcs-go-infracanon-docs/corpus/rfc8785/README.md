## key_sorting.json / key_sorting.out.json
Derived from RFC 8785 §3.2.3 sorting example and expected member order.

## number_samples.json
This file is a convenience set of numeric values around RFC 8785 boundary cases. It is **not** a golden-output vector.  
Golden number mappings are tracked in `corpus/numbers/rfc8785_appendix_b.csv` and in the V8 differential corpus.
