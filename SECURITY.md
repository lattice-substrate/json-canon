# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report security issues privately to the project maintainers. Do not open public issues for unpatched vulnerabilities.

Include:
- affected version and environment
- reproduction steps and input sample
- observed impact
- suggested mitigation (if known)

Maintainers target an initial response within 5 business days.

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are provided for:
- latest release on the default branch
- previous minor release line (when one exists)

## Disclosure Process

1. Maintainers acknowledge receipt and triage severity.
2. A fix is developed and validated in CI.
3. A coordinated release is published with notes and upgrade guidance.
4. Public disclosure follows release availability.
